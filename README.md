# BactiPipe  

**BactiPipe** was developed and is actively used by the **NGS section of the Penn State Animal Diagnostic Laboratory** to bring **consistency** to the analysis of **BACTERIAL** whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Multiple tools and parameters are available for genomic data analysis but this flexibility often leads to variability in results from run to run. In diagnostic laboratories, such variability may compromize one of the most critical aspects of quality control in a diagnostic setting: **reproducibility and standardization**. BactiPipe addresses this challenge by wrapping together the core tools used in our laboratory with carefully chosen and fixed parameters, ensuring consistent analysis across all sequencing runs.  

BactiPipe provides **end-to-end quality control and genome assembly workflows** for both **Illumina** and **Oxford Nanopore** sequencing data. It automates read QC, genome assembly, organism identification, and assembly quality checks using tools such as **fastp, filtlong, Spades, Unicycler, Flye, KmerFinder, Kraken2,** and **CheckM**. The pipeline supports data from **local directories, network-mounted storage, and Amazon S3**, making it suitable for both on-premises and cloud-based environments. Outputs include detailed logs, quality metrics plots, assembled genomes, and comprehensive QC summary reports.  

For a detailed description of the pipeline, workflows, and usage examples, please see the [**BactiPipe Wiki Page**](https://github.com/mauricebyuka/bactiPipe/wiki).
